# Randomizer
A profile based randomizer written in Lua

WARNING: Not functional on Windows natively yet.
Known Supported Systems: 
Ubuntu 18.04+ 
Any distro that uses GTK3+ *SHOULD* be fine as far as I am aware. Please let me know otherwise.

REQUIREMENTS:
Lua 5.3+


Instructions:
1) Clone Repo
2) Run Launch.sh (If your lua isn't accessed as lua5.3, you may need to fix this. Changes may also be needed if you don't run this from it's normal location)
